    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This recipe is not quite a gumbo and more of a stew but we will call it gumbo since that is what inspired it. Regardless this is a hearty dish that can be tailored to your tastes and packs some spice and incredible protein content. Best served over rice and makes a great meal prep.</p>
    <h3>Equipment Needed<h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Dutch oven</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Ingredients<h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 Cup butter</li>
        <li>3/4 Cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 Onion chopped fine</li>
        <li>1 Green bell pepper chopped fine</li>
        <li>3 Celery ribs chopped fine</li>
        <li>5 Garlic cloves minced</li>
        <li>3tsp Paprika</li>
        <li>2tsp Cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>4 Cups chicken stock</li>
        <li>2lbs boneless skinless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>8oz Andouille sausage cut into rounds</li>
        <li>Scallions sliced thin</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p><strong>Make sure to add salt and taste throughout the cooking process.</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>On the stove sweat the onions, peppers, and celery on medium high heat in some vegetable oil until the onions are turning translucent.</li>
        <li>At this point bring the heat down to medium and add in your garlic and seasonings and cook for another 5 minutes avoiding burning the garlic.</li>
        <li>Add in the stock and nestle in the chicken thighs so they are for the most part submerged. Bring to a simmer then set the heat to medium-low, cover it, and let it cook for 20 minutes or until the chicken thighs are done.</li>
        <li>While the chicken thighs cook make a dark cup of roux using the flour and butter being careful not to burn it.</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken thighs to a cutting board to let cool. Add the roux and andouille sausage while stirring to avoid clumps. Let this cook for 30-40min on low heat stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Shred the chicken and add it in with the scallions. Serve in a bowl over rice with some chopped fresh scallions on top.</li>
    </ol>
