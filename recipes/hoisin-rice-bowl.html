    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a quick and delicious meal that can be a go to high protein lunch or dinner. As long as you have a rice cooker the only real cooking part of this recipe is the chicken. I would recommend experimenting and adding whatever you want to this that will fit the flavor profile. You could have this for lunch every single day.</p>
