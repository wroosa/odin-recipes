    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This recipe is a peasant dish from france that uses ingredients the people at that time would have had access to. It is incredibly hearty and rich with a high fat content and unctuous mouth feel. Great in winter time or when you need something that will impress a dinner crew. Often best served with a nice red wine and crusty french bread with lots of butter. The last thing to note is that this stew is often best the day after you make it and keeps for ~5 days in the fridge.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients<h3>
    <ul>
        <h4>Main Ingredients</h4>
        <li>4lbs Boneless pork butt (Pork Shoulder)</li>
        <li>2 Onions halved</li>
        <li>5 Cups of water</li>
        <li>4 Cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 Meaty smoked ham shanks</li>
        <li>4 Carrots</li>
        <li>1lb Yukon gold potatoes</li>
        <li>12oz Kielbasa</li>
        <li>1/2 Head of savoy cabbage</li>
        <h4>Bouquet Garni</h4>
        <li>Parsley</li>
        <li>Thyme</li>
        <li>5 Garlic cloves</li>
        <li>2 Bay leaves</li>
        <li>1tbsp Black peppercorns </li>
        <li>3 Whole cloves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325Â°F. Wrap all the bouquet garni ingredients in cheesecloth and secure it with string/twine.</li>
        <li>Bring the bouquet garni and all main ingredients but the carrots, potatoes, cabbage, and kielbasa to a simmer with the lid off while skimming any scum that rises to the top. This ensures a clearer broth with less particles or bitterness. Simmer for 15 minutes or until the broth is clear and not producing any more scum.</li>
        <li>Put the lid on and put it in the oven for 1hr 15min. While the stew is in the oven chop the carrots and potatoes into 1/2 inch cubes or any bite size piece you desire. Also chop the kielbasa into stew size pieces and chop the cabbage into 2-3 inch strips.</li>
        <li>Add the kielbasa and cabbage and continue to bake lid on for another 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the ham shanks but do not discard them. Add the carrots and potatoes and continue to bake for another 30 min or until the carrots and potatoes are soft. Shred the meat from the ham shanks and discard the rest or save for stock.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and add the meat from the ham shanks. Add a splash of white vinegar if you have it to add a little acid. Serve in a bowl with some chopped parsley on top.</li>
    </ol>
